Vehicles can be equipped to generate and transmit Probe Data Messages (PDMs), Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) or ITS SPOT messages which can be transmitted by Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) and/or via cellular. The TCA program version 2 build 3 or 2.3 includes simulated communication disruptions between vehicles and roadside equipment. As soon as a vehicle equipped to transmit via DSRC is in range of a RSE, it will download all of its snapshot information directly with a probabilistic uncertainty of the data being lost. Similarly, if the vehicle is equipped to transmit via cellular, it will download all its snapshot information directly but those snapshots might be lost or delayed due to user-defined loss rate and latency. In TCA 2.3, BSMs and PDMs can also be made to transmit at user-defined intervals.\"", "organization": "OSADP ", "category": "Traffic Management"}, {"name": "Traffic-Congestion-State-Predictor-Tool", "url": "https://github.com/OSADP/Traffic-Congestion-State-Predictor-Tool", "description": "The Connected Vehicle Big Data Analytics Tool code is designed to predict traffic congestion in an 100 ft x 100 ft area every minute an hour ahead of time using Basic Safety Messages (BSM) or average speed data from INRIX.", "organization": "OSADP ", "category": "Traffic Management"}, {"name": "Transportation-Analysis-Project-Costing-Tool", "url": "https://github.com/OSADP/Transportation-Analysis-Project-Costing-Tool", "description": "Transportation Analysis Project Costing Tool  is a spreadsheet tool that produces ballpark estimates of labor hours required for surface transportation analysis based on a small number of user inputs.", "organization": "OSADP ", "category": "Traffic Management"}]}, {"category": "Traveler Information ", "repos": [{"name": "D-RIDE-AMS", "url": "https://github.com/OSADP/D-RIDE-AMS", "description": "Dynamic Ridesharing: D-RIDE AMS consist of the source-code and the compiled application used as part of the AMS (Analysis, Modeling and Simulation Testbeds for DMA and ATDM Evaluation) Phoenix Testbed.", "organization": "OSADP", "category": "Traveler Information "}, {"name": "FHWA-Relative-Mode-Share-Impacts-under-Different-Shared-Rides-Scenarios", "url": "https://github.com/scottrmiddleton/FHWA-Relative-Mode-Share-Impacts-under-Different-Shared-Rides-Scenarios", "description": "This repository contains analytical code developed for the FHWA sponsored project on Analysis of Travel Choices and Scenarios for Sharing Rides.", "organization": "scottrmiddleton", "category": "Traveler Information "}, {"name": "V2I-Hub", "url": "https://github.com/OSADP/V2I-Hub", "description": "Integrated V2I Prototype: V2I Hub was developed to support jurisdictions in deploying connected vehicle technology by reducing  integration issues and enabling use of their existing transportation management hardware and systems.
